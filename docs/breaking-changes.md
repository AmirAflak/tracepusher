## v0.3.0 to v0.4.0
Argument handling was entirely re-written for `v0.4.0` and `tracepusher` expects different arguments for [v0.3.0](https://github.com/agardnerIT/tracepusher/releases/tag/0.3.0) and [v0.4.0](https://github.com/agardnerIT/tracepusher/releases/tag/0.4.0).

[Here is the readme for v0.3.0](https://github.com/agardnerIT/tracepusher/tree/88e6479213a952eed7985d28b1ef49a4396fe992).
